Box Plot (Matplotlib & Seaborn):
Generates a box plot for visualizing data distribution, central tendency, and outliers.
Matplotlib and Seaborn provide similar outputs, with Seaborn offering enhanced aesthetics.

Mean, Mode, Median:
Calculates central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) for a list of numbers.
Variance and standard deviation calculated for dispersion.

Histogram:
Plots frequency distribution of values in bins.
Displays data spread and common values.

Probability Density Function (PDF):
Plots PDF using mean and standard deviation for data distribution.
Visualizes data probability distribution across values.

Violin Plot:
Uses Seaborn to compare distributions across multiple groups.
Combines box plot with kernel density plot for richer data visualization.

IQR (Interquartile Range):
Calculates IQR for data dispersion and outliers.
Outliers identified by data outside lower and upper bounds.

Log-Normal Distribution:
Simulates log-normal distribution data.
Displays distribution using histogram and KDE for density visualization.

Statistics with Tips Dataset:
Computes mean, median, and mode for total_bill in the dataset.
Visualizations include box plots and histograms for data distribution.

Iris Dataset Analysis:
Plots distribution of sepal_width using histogram.
Displays spread and density of values for sepal_width.
